/*
Create a table space DSN8S12D in database DSN8D12A.
Let Db2 define the data sets, using storage group DSN8G120.
The primary space allocation is 52 kilobytes; the secondary, 20 kilobytes.
The data sets need not be erased before they are deleted.
Locking on tables in the space is to take place at the page level.
Associate the table space with buffer pool BP1.
The data sets can be closed when no one is using the table space.
